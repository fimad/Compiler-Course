=For Friday
  -change how variables are handled (DONE)
    -don't use the stack, use several static variables to map the progress of a single "real" variable throughout the function
    -to start off with it looks it would be valid to generate "invalid" llvm with just %x = whatever, %x = whatever
    -then the following steps will properly resolve that
  -phi insertion
    -create a theta LLVM opcode  (DONE)
    -Dominance Frontier (NOT DEBUGED)
    -add phi
  -variable renaming

=For General Correctness
  -available expression analysis does not work for programs with loops
  -make syntax pretty

=For because it would be cool
  -nested functions
    -determine which variables are used in inner scope, and make them present in the stack
    -implicit first parameter to functions which is the static frame pointer
  -classes
  -types
    -arrays
